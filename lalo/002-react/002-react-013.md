# Redux

-   Third Party library that can be used in any JavaScript project, not just React:
    -   State management system
        -   Local state: Affects a single component
        -   Cross-Component State: It’s share between a few components and can be managed with prop drilling, like modals
        -   App-Wide State: Is shared across the app and it’s better to manage it using a context, like authentication, here’s where Redux comes handy
-   Redux toolkit simplifies its use
-   Difference with React Context API:
    -   React context is better for small or medium applications
        -   It’s not good for applications with a lot of data changes
        -   It can lead to a deeply nested JSX code or huge context providers
    -   Redux has better performance on larger Apps
-   How does Redux works?

    -   It has one Central Data (State) Store
    -   The data store can be accessed across the whole App
    -   Reducers[^1] modify the data on the store through dispatch actions
    -   When the reducer is triggered it modifies the state and the value is updated in the UI

-   Simple example outside of react:

    ```JS
    const redux = require('redux');

    /*
    * The reducer function is responsible for updating the state based on the action.
    * It holds the state of the application and returns a new state based on the action.
    * It should be a pure function: Returns an output with equal structure than the input.
    * It can't hold side effects inside, like fetching an API.
    *
    * - Note that state needs a default value.
    *
    * @param {Object}, {Object}
    *
    */
    const counterReducer = (state = { counter: 0 }, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCREMENT':
                return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
            case 'DECREMENT':
                return { counter: state.counter - 1 };
            case 'ADD':
                return { counter: state.counter + action.value };
            case 'SUBSTRACT':
                return { counter: state.counter - action.value };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    };

    /*
    * Now that we have a reducer, we need to create a store
    * and pass our counterReducer to it as an argument,
    * this way the store will know how to update its state.
    *
    */
    const store = redux.createStore(counterReducer);

    /*
    * Now that we have a store, we can create a subscriber function
    * that will be called every time the state changes.
    *
    * @param {Function}
    */
    const contentSubscriber = () => {
        // First we get the latest state snapshot from the store.
        const latestState = store.getState();
        console.log(latestState);
    }

    // Now that we have a store and a subscriber, we can start listening to the store.
    store.subscribe(contentSubscriber);

    // Now that we have a store, we can dispatch an action.
    store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // { counter: 1 }
    store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }); // { counter: 0 }
    store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD', value: 10 }); // { counter: 10 }
    store.dispatch({ type: 'SUBSTRACT', value: 5 }); // { counter: 5 }
    ```

[^1]: Reducer is a general concept in development, it refers to a function that takes a value and modify it.
