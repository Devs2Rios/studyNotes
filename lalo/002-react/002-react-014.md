# React Router

-   Routing: Different URL paths load different things
-   On static websites it was achieved by sending a different `HTML` files when a different route was used
-   React can handle URL changes with client side code without fetching a new `HTML`

## Setup

-   On an existing app install [the package](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial)
    ```SHELL
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```
-   Then we'll need to configure our `Router`

    ```TSX
    import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
    import Home from "./pages/Home";
    import Artists from "./pages/Artists";
    import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";

    // First we need to configure our routes.
    // We use createBrowserRouter() to create a router with a list of routes.
    const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/", element: <Home />,
    },
    {
        path: "/artists", element: <Artists />,
    },
    {
        path: "*", element: <NotFound />,
    },
    ]);

    // And with the RouterProvider we inject our routes to our App
    export default function App(): JSX.Element {
    return (
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
    );
    }
    ```
