# Unit Testing

-   Manual testing
    -   When the developer writes some code and test it's output
    -   Error prone and hard to test all scenarios
-   Automatic testing
    -   Write extra code to test our apps and cover edge cases

## Types of Tests

-   Unit tests
    -   Test individual building blocks
    -   Usually a lot of tests
    -   Most common/important
-   Integration tests
    -   Test a combination of unit tests
    -   Least common
-   End-to-End (e2e) Tests
    -   Test complete scenarios (like authentication)
    -   Just a few

## What to Test

-   What?
    -   Smallest building blocks
-   How
    -   Test success and error possibilities

## Tools and Setup

-   We need a tool for running our tests and asserting results
    -   Usually Jest
-   For react specific context we need a tool that simulates rendering of our components
    -   React Testing Library
-   Test files have the name of the component plus a `.test` nomenclature, let's say `App.test.tsx` will be the test of `App.tsx`

    -   Tests are usually run with the `npm run test` script which is bound to `react-scripts test` in a `create-react-app` project but it changes depending on every project setup and tool

        -   Test example

            ```SHELL
            $ npm run test

            No tests found related to files changed since last commit.
            Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.

## Testing

-   The three A's

    -   Arrange -> Set up the test data, conditions and environment
    -   Act -> Run logic to be tested
    -   Assert -> Check that the results match the expectations

        ```TSX
        // Component
        export default function Greeting() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
                    <p>It's nice to meet you!</p>
                </div>
            );
        }
        ```

        ```TSX
        // Test
        import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
        import Greeting from "./Greeting";

        // Testing suites are groups of related tests and start use the describe() function to group the tests:
        describe("Greeting component", () => {
            // test() is globally available
            test('Renders "Hello World"', () => {
                // Arrange
                render(<Greeting />);
                // Act
                // ...
                // Assert
                const helloWorldElement = screen.getByText(/Hello World/i);
                expect(helloWorldElement).toBeInTheDocument();
            });
            test('Has a greeting"', () => {
                render(<Greeting />);
                const greetingParagraph = screen.getByText(/nice to meet you/i);
                expect(greetingParagraph).toBeInTheDocument();
            });
            test('Greeting has changed', () => {
                render(<Greeting />);
                const newGreeting = 'Good to see you again';
                const customGreetingInput = screen.getByPlaceholderText(
                    'Enter custom greeting'
                );
                const greetingParagraph = screen.getByText(/nice to meet you/i);
                expect(greetingParagraph).toBeInTheDocument();
                const setCustomGreetingButton = screen.getByRole('button');
                // Act
                fireEvent.change(customGreetingInput, {
                    target: { value: newGreeting },
                });
                act(() => setCustomGreetingButton.click());
                // Assert
                const customGreetingParagraph = screen.getByText(newGreeting);
                expect(greetingParagraph).not.toBeInTheDocument();
                expect(customGreetingParagraph).toBeInTheDocument();
