# Unit Testing

-   Manual testing
    -   When the developer writes some code and test it's output
    -   Error prone and hard to test all scenarios
-   Automatic testing
    -   Write extra code to test our apps and cover edge cases

## Types of Tests

-   Unit tests
    -   Test individual building blocks
    -   Usually a lot of tests
    -   Most common/important
-   Integration tests
    -   Test a combination of unit tests
    -   Least common
-   End-to-End (e2e) Tests
    -   Test complete scenarios (like authentication)
    -   Just a few

## What to Test

-   What?
    -   Smallest building blocks
-   How
    -   Test success and error possibilities

## Tools and Setup

-   We need a tool for running our tests and asserting results
    -   Usually Jest
-   For react specific context we need a tool that simulates rendering of our components
    -   React Testing Library
-   Test files have the name of the component plus a `.test` nomenclature, let's say `App.test.ts` will be the test of `App.ts`

    -   Tests are usually run with the `npm run test` script which is bound to `react-scripts test` in a `create-react-app` project but it changes depending on every project setup and tool

        -   Test example

            ```SHELL
            $ npm run test

            No tests found related to files changed since last commit.
            Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.
