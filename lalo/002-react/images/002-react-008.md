# React Behind the Scenes and Optimization Techniques

## How React really works

-   JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   All about components
-   React don't care about the DOM, it cares about the virtual DOM, and the state, props and context that modify the components
-   Rect determines how the Component tree looks like and how it should look
-   It updates the virtual DOM and decides what to inject in the real DOM
-   React only updates components and changes in the dom just when differences between evaluations happend, which is better for performance
