# React.js

## General concepts

> <b>What's React?</b>
>
> -   React is a client-side JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> -   It helps you building modern user interfaces for the web.
> -   Just with JavaScript you have to write everything, imperative (every instruction) approach, reinventing the wheel over and over again, which is not quite so good.
> -   It makes building the interfaces easier in an declarative (not all the instructions) way.
> -   With react you create single page applications because it controls all the elements of the page, even routes, this drives to a better user experience.
> -   Some features like routing are added via packages.
