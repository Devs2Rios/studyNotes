# React State and Working With Events

## Events

- The events are rather simple to use in react, they just need a function to be passes in

```JSX
const Component = () => <button onClick={() => (document.title = Math.random())}>Change title</button>
```

- Try to keep your code clean and readable

```JSX
const Component = () => {
    const changeTitle = () => (document.title = Math.random());
    // Pass the function inside the event without parenthesis
    // The parenthesis will make the function to execute while parsing not when the event happens
    return <button onClick={changeTitle}>Change title</button>
}
```
