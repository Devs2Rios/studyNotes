# React behind the scenes

-   React is a library for building UIs
-   The components are the key for building the interfaces
-   React DOM manages the elements regardless what they contain
-   `Props -> Components (context, state) -> Real Dom`
    -   The virtual DOM determines what to send to the real DOM and what to do with the virtual DOM
    -   Re-Evaluating components is different to Re-Render the DOM
    -   Real DOM is changed rarely which makes rendering faster
    -   DOM Diffing: Finding the difference between DOM evaluations between newer snapshots and previous ones
-   React just executes re-rendering when state, context or props change
-   Even if a react component is re-evaluated after every change mentioned before, the actual DOM just adds new elements, like conditional elements that appear and disappear
-   Side note: Even if you don’t use a state if the component is re-executed, all of its children will be re-evaluated, this needs optimization

    ```JSX
    export default function App() {
        // This will re-render App and all of its children
        // but in the real DOM just the h2 element will be modified
        const changeTitleHandler = () => setListTitle('New Title');

        return (
            <div className="app">
                <h2>{props.title}</h2>
                <Button onClick={changeTitleHandler}>Change List Title</Button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

-   export default React.memo(Component);

        ```JSX
        const Button = (props) => {
            console.log('Button RUNNING');
            return (
                <button
                    type={props.type || 'button'}
                    className={`${classes.button} ${props.className}`}
                    onClick={props.onClick}
                    disabled={props.disabled}
                >
                    {props.children}
                </button>
            );
        };

        export default React.memo(Button);
        ```

    -   This simple action will prevent the component to be unnecessarily re-evaluated
    -   This forces props comparing props
    -   Just use it in components that won’t change
    -   If there’s a function triggering inside the component it will execute again even though React.memo() is implemented
    -   Re-evaluation prevention just works with primitives

-   `useCallback()`

    -   Save the function to use it
    -   Functions are closures, with useCallback you tell React to store the function somewhere in the memory and the values from inside the function are the function itself is not re-evaluated unnecessarily

    ```JSX
    export default function App() {
        const changeTitleHandler = useCallback(() => {
            setListTitle('New Title');
        }, []);

        return (
            <div className="app">
                <h2>{props.title}</h2>
                <Button onClick={changeTitleHandler}>Change List Title</Button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

-   A closer look at State and Components
    -   Components and their interaction with state is crucial
    -   useState() only considers the first value once and re-evaluate it when it changes or when it’s removed from the DOM and then re-used
-   When a state changes there’s a step between the change request and the actual change and it’s a Scheduled State Change which is very fast and imperceptible
    -   There can be multiple updates scheduled at the same time, this is important for the execution order and to ensure that the previous state is re-evaluated when there’s a change
    -   You need to address possible changes of outdated data which lead to bugs
-   Our code manages state changes with executions using the schedule state for that, in most cases it will be immediately but in some others won’t, to avoid outdated state is importan to use useCallback in these cases, specially if there’s a function that changes the state depending on the same previous state
-   State batching happens when we call several state changes in the same function, React will put them in the Schedule State Change and execute them later
-   useMemo() is useful to optimize and memoize any kind of data, it is very useful for objects,

    ```JSX
    // App.js
    import React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';

    import './App.css';
    import DemoList from './components/Demo/DemoList';
    import Button from './components/UI/Button/Button';

    function App() {
      const [listTitle, setListTitle] = useState('My List');

      const changeTitleHandler = useCallback(() => {
        setListTitle('New Title');
      }, []);

      const listItems = useMemo(() => [5, 3, 1, 10, 9], []);

      return (
        <div className="app">
          <DemoList title={listTitle} items={listItems} />
          <Button onClick={changeTitleHandler}>Change List Title</Button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

    ```JSX
    // DemoList.js
    import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

    import classes from './DemoList.module.css';

    const DemoList = (props) => {
      const { items } = props;

      const sortedList = useMemo(() => {
        console.log('Items sorted');
        return items.sort((a, b) => a - b);
      }, [items]);
      console.log('DemoList RUNNING');

      return (
        <div className={classes.list}>
          <h2>{props.title}</h2>
          <ul>
            {sortedList.map((item) => (
              <li key={item}>{item}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default React.memo(DemoList);
    ```

    ```JSX
    // Button.js
    import React from 'react';

    import classes from './Button.module.css';

    const Button = (props) => {
      console.log('Button RUNNING');
      return (
        <button
          type={props.type || 'button'}
          className={`${classes.button} ${props.className}`}
          onClick={props.onClick}
          disabled={props.disabled}
        >
          {props.children}
        </button>
      );
    };

    export default React.memo(Button);
    ```

    -   The data is stored in the memory, so we need to be careful when selecting the values to use with the hook
