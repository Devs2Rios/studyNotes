# Deployment

## Steps

1. Test the code before deploying it (App ready to use)
2. Optimize the code for production

    - Lazy loading

        - Handles the loading of the whole page (very useful for big apps)
        - Loads the code when it's needed

            ```JSX
            import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
            import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

            const Users = lazy(() => import('./pages/Users'));
            const User = lazy(() => import('./pages/User'));
            // The lazy function allows us to use the element as a component

            const router = createBrowserRouter([
                {
                    path: "/",
                    element: <Layout />,
                    errorElement: <NotFound />
                    children: [
                        { index: true, element: <Home /> },
                        {
                            path: "/users",
                            children: [
                                {
                                    index: true,
                                    element: <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}><Users /></Suspense>,
                                    // Suspense is needed for lazy loading
                                    loader: () => import('./pages/Users').then(module => module.loader())
                                    // Lazy loading calling import() and returning the module loader
                                },
                                {
                                    path: ':id',
                                    element: <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}><User /></Suspense>,
                                    loader: (meta) => import('./pages/User').then(module => module.loader(meta))
                                    // We need to pass our props to the loader
                                },
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },
            ]);
            ```

3. Build your app (minified version of our app)

    - In React we'll usually run `npm run build` to generate our production code
    - The result will be now ready to be uploaded

4. Upload the production code to a server

    - React Single Page Applications (SPA) are static websites (`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`)
    - SPA applications will only need a Static Site Host like GitHub pages, firebase hosting, etcetera

5. Configure the server/hosting provider

    - When server side rendering is needed we'll need to configure the project that way
    - Firebase hosting asks if the project is a SPA or not, but in other hosts it will need to be configured
