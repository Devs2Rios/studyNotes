# Authentication

-   Is needed if content needs to be protected
-   When the user send the request to the server it needs to be validated by the user's credentials
    -   If the credentials are right the user can now access to the protected content
    -   The most common ways to protect data are:
        -   Server-side Sessions
            - Unique ID on the server that sends the same ID to the client
            - The client sends the ID back to the server with the requests
        -   Authentication Tokens
            - Permission token sent by the server to the client (not stored)
            - The token is held by the client and used to send requests (validated by an algorithm)
