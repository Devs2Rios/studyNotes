# Class Based Components

-   They are an alternative to functional components and is Class based component, which was the standard in earlier versions of React (<16.8)

    ```JSX
    import { Component } from 'react';

    class MyComponent extends Component {
        render() {
            return <p>I'm a class component</p>
        }
    }
    ```

    -   Class based components have a `render()` function that determines what's going to be rendered inside the DOM
    -   Before hooks (React 16.8) you were not able to modify the state of your components with functions

        ```JSX
        import { Component, Fragment } from 'react';

        class User extends Component {
            constructor() {
                super(props);
                this.state = {
                    showUsers: false,
                };
                /*
                You need to bind the methods in your component
                    in order to actually update the state,
                    you can do it here in the constructor
                or directly in your JSX
                */
                this.someHandler = this.someHandler.bind(this);
            }
            // Methods will look like this
            someHandler() {
                // You can set state this way
                this.setState(prevState => {
                    return { showUsers: !prevState.showUsers };
                });
            }
            render() {
                return (
                    <Fragment>
                        {/* You need to use the this keyword since you're working with a class */}
                        <button onClick={this.someHandler}>{this.props.name}</button>
                        <p> {this.state.showUsers ? 'Users' : 'No users'} </p>
                    </Fragment>
                );
            }
        }

        export default User;
        ```

-   Setting state with this approach is a bit different from functional components, since the state is an object is referenced and when you update it's not overwritten as with the useState() hook, it's modified and merged into the component's state
-   Class based components can be used with functional components

## Component lifecycle

-   `componentDidMount()` -> Component mounted -> `useEffect(() => {}, [])` with an empty dependency array
-   `componentDidUpdate()` -> Component updated -> `useEffect(() => {}, [dep1, dep2])` with dependencies
-   `componentWillUnmount()` -> Component removed from DOM -> `useEffect(() => {return() => {â€¦}}, [])` with a cleanup return function

    ```JSX
    import { Component, Fragment } from 'react';

    class MyComponent extends Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                someState: false,
                name: 'Lou',
                data: {},
            };
        }
        // Here the data state will update at the beginning
        // and will only run once
        componentDidMount() {
            //... FetchAPI logic
            this.setState({ data: response.data });
        }
        componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
            // This conditional is to avoid an infinite loop
            // It's like putting the variable in the dependency array
            if (prevProps.name !== this.state.name) {
                // This will just evaluate someState when name changes
                this.setState({ someState: name === 'Juan' });
            }
        }
        componentWillUnmount() {
            /*
        If this component is used by a parent one
        and it will be removed at some point,
        this is the function to add the logic of the cleanup,
        like removing an event listener or timeout
        */
        }
        changeName() {
            const names = ['Juan', 'Lou', 'Diana'];
            return names[Math.round(Math.random() * (names.length - 1))];
        }
        render() {
            return (
                <Fragment>
                    <p>{this.state.name}</p>
                    {this.state.someState && <p>Hi Juan!</p>}
                    <button onClick={this.changeName}>Change name</button>
                </Fragment>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

## Context

-   There is not an exact same way to use context as you use them with hooks, with hooks you can use multiple contexts, and with class based components you can only use one

    ```JSX
    import { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
    import MyContext from './MyContext';

    class MyComponent extends Component {
        // Here you make the context to be consumable
        static contextType = MyContext;

        render() {
            return (
                <Fragment>
                    {/* You can now consume the content of your context */}
                    <div>{this.context.title}</div>
                </Fragment>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

## Error Boundaries

-   Error boundaries are useful when there's an inevitable error in our applications, like offline servers or anything out of our control
-   Error boundary will protect your components from the errors mentioned before

    ```JSX
    import { Component } from 'react';

    class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = { hasError: false };
        }
        componentDidCatch(Error) {
            this.setState({ hasError: true });
        }
        render() {
            if (this.state.hasError) {
                return <p>There's an error</p>;
            }
            return this.props.children;
        }
    }

    export default ErrorBoundary;
    ```

-   You just need to wrap them

    ```JSX
    import { Component } from 'react';
    import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary';

    class MyComponent extends Component {
        componentDidMount() {
            if (this.props.data.length === 0) {
                throw new Error('No data provided!');
            }
        }
        render() {
            return (
                <ErrorBoundary>
                    <p>Protected from error</p>
                </ErrorBoundary>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

-   Now you can catch errors and manage them in an elegant way.

## Conclusion

-   Prefer functional components
-   Just use class based when you:
    -   Prefer them
    -   You're in a project made that way
-   If you're building error boundaries
