# React.js

## General concepts

> - React is a client-side JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> - It helps you building modern user interfaces for the web.
> - Just with JavaScript you have to write everything, imperative approach, reinventing the wheel over and over again, which is not quite so good.
> - It makes building the interfaces easier in an declarative way.
> - With react you create single page applications because it controls all the elements of the page, even routes, this drives to a better user experience.
> - Some features like routing are added via packages.

## Similar libraries and frameworks

> - Angular: a component-based UI framework with complete features (TypeScript).
> - Vue.js: Between Angular and React, is a component-based UI framework with most of the core features needed for UI development.
